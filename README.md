# 📹 WebRTC Multi-Participant Video Call Study Project (NestJS, TypeScript, React.js)

Welcome to the **WebRTC Real-Time Video Call** project!  

This repository is dedicated to exploring and practicing WebRTC technology for enabling real-time video call connections between multiple participants, using a modern stack: **NestJS** (TypeScript) for the backend signaling server and **React.js** for the frontend.
